# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Nested Finance smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between June 15—June 18 2022.

## Wardens

# Medium Risk Findings (1)
## [[M-01] User can bypass `entryFee` by sending arbitrary `calldata` to ParaSwap operator](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested-findings/issues/69)
_Submitted by 0xDjango_

[NestedFactory.sol#L466](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L466)<br>
[ParaswapOperator.sol#L34](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/operators/Paraswap/ParaswapOperator.sol#L34)<br>

Any user is able to bypass the `entryFee` collection when using `NestedFactory.create()` by passing in arbitrary calldata when using the ParaSwap router. High level, a user can pass in calldata to swap from a miniscule amount of input token to an ERC777 with themselves as the recipient and will gain control of execution, at which time they can send a large amount of output token back to the Nested Factory.

If the user sends `1 wei` of input token, the Nested Factory will return an `entryFee` of `0` due to precision loss. The amount of output token returned to the contract via the direct transfer from the user will then be deposited in the vault.

### Proof of Concept

**Steps**

*   User calls `NestedFactory.create()` with a single input order. This input order will define the parameters of the call to Paraswap.
*   The single order defines the following in pseudocode:
    1.  inputToken: Any token, but we'll use address(0) ETH
    2.  amount: 1 wei
    3.  Order(operator=Paraswap, token=USDC, calldata=calldata)

***The calldata used in the call to paraswap would swap from ETH to any ERC777 (NOT USDC), with an attack contract address set as the `beneficiary`. Upon transferring the swapped ERC777 to the user's attack contract, the contract would immediately send e.g. 1,000,000 USDC directly back to the Nested Factory contract.***

*   The Paraswap operator checks the balances of the buy and sell tokens. Note that the buy token is defined in the Order token parameter, not the calldata passed to Paraswap. Since the operator will check the balance of USDC, it looks like we've swapped 1 wei ETH for 1,000,000 USDC.
*   The Paraswap operator returns the swap amounts back to Nested Factory.
*   Nested Factory deposits the 1,000,000 USDC to the vault for the user without charging any `entryFee`.

NOTE: I use 1 wei as an extreme example. You would have to ensure that you're swapping at least enough to receive 1 wei of the ERC777 to transfer to the attack contract.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allowing a user to pass arbitrary call data to a router is risky because routers allow several paths for an attacker to gain control of execution. Originally, I believed this exploit to be possible simply by swapping to ETH, which would perform an external call to the `beneficiary`, but Paraswap actually only forwards 10,000 gas when performing ETH transfers. If Nested plans to include a vanilla Uniswap router operator, this would be an issue. Here is the Paraswap transfer logic:

    function transferTokens(
            address token,
            address payable destination,
            uint256 amount
        )
        internal
        {
            if (amount > 0) {
                if (token == ETH_ADDRESS) {
                    (bool result, ) = destination.call{value: amount, gas: 10000}("");
                    require(result, "Failed to transfer Ether");
                }
                else {
                    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(destination, amount);
                }
            }

        }

Therefore, it might be worth exploring the option of allowing the user to only choose from a list of predefined function signatures when making calls to Paraswap. The final `Order` param that is passed to the operator would be built within the contract by concatenating the function, input, and output tokens. Even then, if the output token truly is an ERC777, the user would be able to intercept control and directly transfer more of the ERC777.

A large-scale fix would be to charge the entry fee on the amount of output tokens after performing the swap. I'm not sure if this falls in line with Nested's plans though.

## Low Risk Issue Summary

**[L-01] Known vulnerabilities exist in currently used @openzeppelin/contracts version**<br>
**[L-02] Impractical Entry/Exit fees are allowed**<br>
**[L-03] poolCoinAmount validation**<br>
**[L-04] Low level calls with solidity version 0.8.14 can result in optimiser bug.**<br>
**[L-05] Unchecked return value of transferFrom can allow a user to withdraw native token for free.**<br>

## [L-01] Known vulnerabilities exist in currently used @openzeppelin/contracts version

As some [known vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts/4.3.2) exist in the current @openzeppelin/contracts version, consider updating package.json with at least @openzeppelin/contracts@4.4.2 here:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/package.json#L65

```solidity
"@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.3.2",
```

While vulnerabilities are known, the current scope isn't affected (this might not hold true for the whole solution).

## [L-02] Impractical Entry/Exit fees are allowed

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L159

It seems that Owner is allowed to set entry/exit fees to be 100% of amount. An entry fees of 100% will be impractical and will lead to all order amount to be gone in fees at `NestedFactory.sol#L378`

### Proof of Concept

1. Admin call setEntryFees function and set _entryFees as 10000.
2. entryFees becomes 100%.
3. Now assume an order is submitted via _submitInOrders.
4. Entry fees will be deducted from amount spent.
5. Since fees is 100% so feesDeducted=amountSpent which means amountSpent effectively becomes 0 as all of it went for fees.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Decide a max percentage of fees say 10% which can be charged and then change the require condition accordingly. Same logic need to be applied for exit fees

`require(_entryFees <= MAX_PERCENTAGE, "NF: FEES_OVERFLOW");`

## [L-03] poolCoinAmount validation

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/libraries/StakingLPVaultHelpers.sol

poolCoinAmount must be 2, 3, 4. so, if it not fall in this range it should be reverted but now it doesn't. On every functions in this file add:

```solidity
if (poolCoinAmount < 2 || poolCoinAmount > 4) revert

## [L-04] Low level calls with solidity version 0.8.14 can result in optimiser bug

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/governance/OwnerProxy.sol#L20

The protocol is using low level calls with solidity version 0.8.14 which can result in optimizer bug.

### Proof of Concept
See POC from [Certora](https://medium.com/certora/overly-optimistic-optimizer-certora-bug-disclosure-2101e3f7994d)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider upgrading to solidity 0.8.15.

## [L-05] Unchecked return value of transferFrom can allow a user to withdraw native token for free

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/governance/OwnerProxy.sol#L20

The Withdrawer contract has a function withdraw() which calls an unsafe transferFrom(). A call to transferFrom is frequently done without checking the results.
For certain ERC20 tokens, if insufficient tokens are present, no revert occurs but a result of "false" is returned.
As explained in https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/01/fei-protocol/#unchecked-return-value-for-iweth-transfer-call

And in this function case, if the weth.transferFrom() returns false, it would continue the call to withdraw token from the contract and send it to the caller. Thus a user could withdraw free tokens, and eventually some users will be unable to withdraw their tokens.

### Proof of Concept

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/Withdrawer.sol#L26

- Alice calls Withdrawer.withdraw() with 100 as input.
- Assume weth.transferFrom() fails, returns false but does not revert.
- weth.withdraw() will run since there was no revert.
- Alice receives 100 eth for free.
- This may be possible in a direct call by Alice or a call from

YearnCurveVaultOperator contract in
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/operators/Yearn/YearnCurveVaultOperator.sol#L81

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check the result of transferFrom and transfer. Or making use of SafeERC20 library: safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom would be recommended.

## [N-07] Lack of Event Emission For Critical Functions

*BeefyVaultOperator.sol#L36-L67, BeefyVaultOperator.sol#L79-L108, BeefyZapBiswapLPVaultOperator.sol#L46-L77, BeefyZapBiswapLPVaultOperator.sol#L91-L121, BeefyZapUniswapLPVaultOperator.sol#L46-L77, BeefyZapUniswapLPVaultOperator.sol#L91-L121, ParaswapOperator.sol#L22-L48*

### Description
Several functions update critical parameters that are missing event emission. These should be performed to ensure tracking of changes of such critical parameters.

### Recommendation
Add events to functions that change critical parameters.

## [N-08] Too Recent of a Pragma

*Context: [All Contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested)*

### Description
Using too recent of a pragma is risky since they are not battle tested. A rise of a bug that wasn't known on release would cause either a hack or a need to secure funds and redeploy.

### Recommendation
Use a Pragma version that has been used for sometime. I would suggest 0.8.4 for the decrease of risk and still has the gas optimizations implemented.

## [N-09] Missing selector check on operator

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/governance/scripts/OperatorScripts.sol#L28<br>
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/OperatorResolver.sol#L20

The addOperator function is not checking that selector of added operator is not bytes4(0)<br>
Same fix is required for requireAndGetOperator function at OperatorResolver.sol#L20

### Recommendation
Add below check

```
require(operator.selector != bytes4(0), "AO-SCRIPT: INVALID_SELECTOR");
```

## [N-12] Add `namesLength > 0` check in `areOperatorsImported()` method

`areOperatorsImported()` in [OperatorResolver.sol#L32-L49](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/OperatorResolver.sol#L32-L49) returns true when input arrays are empty (ie. `[], []`).


```solidity
function areOperatorsImported(bytes32[] calldata names, Operator[] calldata destinations)
    external
    view
    override
    returns (bool)
{
    uint256 namesLength = names.length;
    require(namesLength == destinations.length, "OR: INPUTS_LENGTH_MUST_MATCH");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < namesLength; i++) {
        if (
            operators[names[i]].implementation != destinations[i].implementation ||

        ) {
            return false;

Consider checking the recipient address for existence before making the call.<br>
If the address does not exist, call will return true and the user will not get the tokens to his wallet.

## [N-16] setMaxAllowance should be called in the constructor

### BeefyVaultOperator.sol

**deposit: setMaxAllowance should be called in the constructor**

In the `deposit` function on [line 48](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b253ed80f67d1bb2a04e1702f5796fd96a7c521e/contracts/operators/Beefy/BeefyVaultOperator.sol#L48), we call `ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(token, vault);` to allow the vault to spend token.<br>

Each time assets are deposited in the vault, we shouldn't have to allow it to spend the token again.<br>

I recommend to call `ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(token, vault)` only once in the constructor for each vault and token. I also recommend to add a `setMaxAllowance` function only callable by the owner of the operator that would allow to set the max allowance in case the allowance has decreased.

**Recommendation**

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < vaultsLength; i++) {
    operatorStorage.addVault(vaults[i], tokens[i]);
    ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(tokens[i], vaults[i]);
}
```

### BeefyZapBiswapLPVaultOperator.sol and BeefyZapUniswapLPVaultOperator.sol

**zapAndStakeLp: setMaxAllowance should be called in the constructor**

In the `_zapAndStakeLp` function on [line 189](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b253ed80f67d1bb2a04e1702f5796fd96a7c521e/contracts/operators/Beefy/lp/BeefyZapBiswapLPVaultOperator.sol#L189) and subsequently on [line 194](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b253ed80f67d1bb2a04e1702f5796fd96a7c521e/contracts/operators/Beefy/lp/BeefyZapBiswapLPVaultOperator.sol#L194) and [195](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b253ed80f67d1bb2a04e1702f5796fd96a7c521e/contracts/operators/Beefy/lp/BeefyZapBiswapLPVaultOperator.sol#L195) we call `ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance();` to allow the vault to spend token.

Each time assets are deposited in the vault, we shouldn't have to allow it to spend the token again.<br>
I recommend to call `ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance()` only once in the constructor for each vault and token. I also recommend to add a setMaxAllowance function only callable by the owner of the operator that would allow to set the max allowance in case the allowance has decreased.

This will also avoid calling `ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(IERC20(swapToken), router);` in the `_withdrawAndSwap` function on line 162.

**Recommendation**

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < vaultsLength; i++) {
    operatorStorage.addVault(vaults[i], routers[i]);

    IBiswapPair pair = IBiswapPair(IBeefyVaultV6(vaults[i]).want());

    ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(IERC20(address(pair)), address(vaults[i]));
    ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(IERC20(pair.token0()), routers[i]);
    ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(IERC20(pair.token1()), routers[i]);
}
```

### YearnCurveVaultOperator.sol

**depositETH: setMaxAllowance should be called in the constructor**

In the `depositETH` function on line [78](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/0dc44d779eaca8f40b7526aabdd81a098dcebf25/contracts/operators/Yearn/YearnCurveVaultOperator.sol#L78), we call `ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(IERC20(address(weth)), address(withdrawer));` to allow the withdrawer to spend weth.

Each time assets are deposited in the vault, we shouldn't have to allow the withdrawer to spend weth again.<br>
I recommend to call `ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(IERC20(address(weth)), address(withdrawer))` only once in the constructor. I also recommend to add a `setMaxAllowance` function only callable by the owner of the operator that would allow to set the max allowance in case the allowance has decreased.

**Recommendation**

```solidity
ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(IERC20(_weth), address(_withdrawer));
```

### StakingLPVaultHelpers.sol

**addLiquidityAndDepositETH: setMaxAllowance should be called in addVault**

In the `addLiquidityAndDepositETH` function on [line 45](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/0dc44d779eaca8f40b7526aabdd81a098dcebf25/contracts/libraries/StakingLPVaultHelpers.sol#L45), we call `ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(lpToken, vault);` to allow the vault to spend lpToken.

Each time assets are deposited in the vault, we shouldn't have to allow the vault to spend lpToken again.<br>
I recommend to call `ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(lpToken, vault);` only once in the addVault function of the YearnVaultStorage. I also recommend to add a setMaxAllowance function only callable by the owner that would allow to set the max allowance in case the allowance has decreased.

This will also avoid calling it in the `_addLiquidityAndDeposit` function on line [77](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/0dc44d779eaca8f40b7526aabdd81a098dcebf25/contracts/libraries/StakingLPVaultHelpers.sol#L77)

**Recommendation**

```solidity
ExchangeHelpers.setMaxAllowance(curvePool.lpToken, vault);
```

## [N-17] Naming inconsistency - some arguments have `_` at their prefixes but others do not at NestedFactory.sol

Throughout the file `NestedFactory.sol`, arguments of functions have _ at their prefixes like function `setFeeSplitter(FeeSplitter _feeSplitter)`. However, following 2 arguments do not have `_` at their prefixes which are not consistent.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L121

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L133


## [N-18] Use either `_msgSender()` or `msg.sender`

Throughout the file `NestedFactory.sol`, `_msgSender()` is used to get the sender. However, following 2 places use msg.sender which seem not consistent.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L89

## [N-19] `OwnerProxy` can call `selfdestruct()`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/governance/OwnerProxy.sol#L9-L36

### Impact

OwnerProxy's selfdestruct

### Proof of Concept

While only the owner (the timelock) can call the execute function, this doesn't mean it can't be compromised or phished to call a malicious `_target`, which could contain a call to `selfdestruct()`.

As `selfdestruct()` would be a simple OPCODE in the context of the OwnerProxy contract (which is the one using `delegatecall()` in `execute()`), this would destroy the contract.

This is a known bug in the community (see the Parity Multisig Hack): delegatecalls from contracts are dangerous.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider making OwnerProxy a library instead of a contract to protect it from being selfdestructed and to further protect its state (that can also be manipulated as a contract)

Alternatively, consider deploying the OwnerProxy contract using CREATE2 so that the contract could be re-created at the same pre-computed address, if need be.

## [N-20] A magic number should be documented and explained. Use a constant instead.

NestedFactory.sol:443:            feesAmount = (amountBought * (_toReserve ? entryFees : exitFees)) / 10000;
```

I suggest using `constant` variables as this would make the code more maintainable and readable while costing nothing gas-wise (constants are replaced by their value at compile-time).

## [N-21] Lack of solhint To Ignore Warnings

Context: [OwnerProxy.sol#L21-L36](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/governance/OwnerProxy.sol#L21-L36), [OperatorScripts.sol#L58-L60](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/governance/scripts/OperatorScripts.sol#L58-L60)

### Description:
solhint is useful to help ignore warnings that aren't really issues. For example the code base has some assembly blocks which promts the warning `Linter: Avoid to use inline assembly. It is acceptable only in rare cases`. Adding in `/* solhint-disable no-inline-assembly */` above it will ignore this warning.

### Recommendation
Use solhint to ignore warnings that aren't really issues.

## [G-01] Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in external functions saves gas

When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using calldata directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution.

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another `internal` function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gas-efficient to use `calldata` when the external function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the `internal` functions from being called. `Structs` have the same overhead as an array of length one

## [G-02] Using `storage` instead of `memory` for structs/arrays saves gas

When fetching data from a `storage` location, assigning the data to a `memory` variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new `memory` variable, they incur an additional `MLOAD` rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the `memory` keyword, declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a `memory` variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires `memory`, or if the array/struct is being read from another `memory` array/struct

## [G-03] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache

The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping's value in a local **storage** variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), **saves ~42 gas** per access due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (**Gkeccak256 - 30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations. Caching an array's struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory.

## [G-04] It costs more gas to initialize non-constant/non-immutable variables to zero than to let the default of zero be applied

Not overwriting the default for [stack variables](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/e075d189c1b23dce256cd166e28f3397) saves 8 gas. Storage and memory variables have larger savings

## [G-06] Using `private` rather than `public` for `constants`, saves gas

If needed, the value can be read from the verified contract source code. Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

## [G-09] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`

If a function modifier such as onlyOwner is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are
`CALLVALUE(2),DUP1(3),ISZERO(3),PUSH2(3),JUMPI(10),PUSH1(3),DUP1(3),REVERT(0),JUMPDEST(1),POP(2)`, which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

## [G-10] The `require` statements could be put at the beginning part of a block of statements if it doesn’t affect the logic to save gas.**

` require(_orders.length != 0, "NF: INVALID_ORDERS");`

These arithmetic operations can be unchecked.

```
uint256 halfInvestment = investmentA / 2;

uint256 halfInvestment = investmentA / 2;
```

This line could be pre-computed and defined as a constant to save gas.
 
```
bytes4(keccak256(bytes("remove_liquidity_one_coin(uint256,int128,uint256)")))
b. bytes4(keccak256(bytes("remove_liquidity_one_coin(uint256,uint256,uint256)")))
```

## [G-11] Unnecessary computation

When emitting an event that includes a new and an old value, it is cheaper in gas to avoid caching the old value in memory. Instead, emit the event, then save the new value in storage.

### Proof of Concept

Instances include:

```solidity
OwnableProxyDelegation.sol
function _setOwner
```

### Recommended Mitigation

Replace

```solidity
address oldOwner = _owner;
_owner = newOwner;
emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner)
```

with

```solidity
emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner_, newOwner)
_owner = newOwner;
```

## [G-12] Mathematical optimizations

`X += Y` costs 22 more gas than `X = X + Y`. This can mean a lot of gas wasted in a function call when the computation is repeated `n` times (loops)

### Proof of Concept

Instances include:

* NestedFactory.sol
* [amountBought -= amountFees](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L266)
* [amountSpent += _submitOrder(address(tokenSold),_batchedOrders.orders[i].token,_nftId,_batchedOrders.orders[i],true // always to the reserve)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L370-L376)
* [ethNeeded += _batchedOrders[i].amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L653)

### Recommended Mitigation

use `X = X + Y` instead of `X += Y` (same with `-`).

## [G-13] Constructor parameters should be avoided when possible

Constructor parameters are expensive. The contract deployment will be cheaper in gas if they are hard coded instead of using constructor parameters. With the compilers parameters in `hardhat.config.ts`, deployment costs approximately `400` more gas per variable written via a constructor parameter.

### Proof of Concept

Instances include:

YearnCurveVaultOperator.sol

[eth = _eth](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/operators/Yearn/YearnCurveVaultOperator.sol#L48)

[withdrawer = _withdrawer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/operators/Yearn/YearnCurveVaultOperator.sol#L50)

### Recommended Mitigation

Hardcode storage variables with their initial value instead of writing it during contract deployment with constructor parameters.

## [G-14] Can save gas when call `_submitOutOrders()` with `_toReserve = false`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L443

In case `_toReserve = false`, it still calculates `feesAmount` using `entryFees` but do not use the result anywhere. We can save gas by calculating `feesAmount` only when `_toReserve = true`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Only calculate `feesAmount` only when `_toReserve = true`

```solidity
if (_toReserve) {
	feesAmount = (amountBought * entryFees) / 10000;
_transferToReserveAndStore(_batchedOrders.outputToken, amountBought - feesAmount, _nftId);
}
```

## [G-15] transferToReserveAndStore: balanceReserveAfter can be inlined

In the `_transferToReserveAndStore` function, we store the reserve balance after the transfer in the balanceReserveAfter variable, on line [523](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b253ed80f67d1bb2a04e1702f5796fd96a7c521e/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L523).

This variable being only used once, we can inline it and save one mstore.

### Recommendation

```solidity
nestedRecords.store(_nftId, address(_token), _token.balanceOf(reserveAddr) - balanceReserveBefore, reserveAddr);
```

## [G-16] Inequality

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b4a153c943d54755711a2f7b80cbbf3a5bb49d76/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L286

Non strict inequality are cheaper than strict one. I suggest to use >= or <= instead of > and < if possible.

**maximebrugel (Nested) responded:**
 > **OK:**
 * [G-1] Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in external functions saves gas
 * [G-2] Using `storage` instead of `memory` for structs/arrays saves gas
 * [G-3] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache
 * [G-5] Splitting `require()` statements that use `&&` saves gas
 * [G-7] Division by two should use bit shifting
 * [G-10] The `require` statements could be put at the beginning part of a block of statements if it doesn’t affect the logic to save gas.
 * [G-12] Mathematical optimizations
 * [G-13] Constructor parameters should be avoided when possible
 * [G-14] Can save gas when call `_submitOutOrders()` with `_toReserve = false`
 * [G-15] transferToReserveAndStore: balanceReserveAfter can be inlined
 * [G-16] Inequality

 > **Acknowledged:**
 * [G-6] Using `private` rather than `public` for `constants`, saves gas
 * [G-11] Unnecessary computation
